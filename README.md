**Boston Housing Price Prediction**
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts housing prices in Boston using the classic Boston Housing dataset. 
The project demonstrates various stages of a machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.


**The goal of this project is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs. This project covers:**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Training multiple machine learning models
Evaluating model performance
Model deployment

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts.
It has 506 instances and 14 attributes (features).

**Features:**
    1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
                 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
                 river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
                 by town
    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
